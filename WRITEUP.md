## ðŸ”§ Tools & Services Used

1. AWS ECS (Fargate) â†’ For container orchestration & serverless compute.

2. Amazon ECR â†’ To store Docker container images.

3. AWS CloudWatch â†’ For centralized logging & monitoring.

4. Jenkins â†’ CI/CD pipeline automation.

5. Docker â†’ Containerization of the application.

6. Terraform / CloudFormation (if used) â†’ Infrastructure as Code for provisioning.

7. GitHub â†’ Version control & project repository.

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced & Solutions

 **ECR Image Pull Failure (latest: not found)**

Cause: The task definition was pointing to the latest tag, but only versioned tags (e.g., :3) existed in ECR.

Solution: Updated ECS task definition to use the correct image tag pushed by Jenkins.

**CloudWatch Log Group Not Found**

Cause: ECS task tried to write logs to a non-existing log group.

Solution: Created the log group (/ecs/devops-task) manually via AWS CLI/Terraform before running ECS tasks.

**Jenkins Agent Missing AWS CLI**

Cause: Jenkins build step failed (aws: not found).

Solution: Installed AWS CLI on Jenkins agent using package manager (apt-get install awscli -y) or added it to the Docker image for the Jenkins agent.

**Networking Issues in Fargate**

Cause: Tasks couldnâ€™t pull images or connect to the internet.

Solution: Ensured ECS task was launched in a VPC with proper subnets, route tables, and an attached Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway.

## ðŸ’¡ Possible Improvements

1. Blue-Green / Rolling Deployments â†’ Safer ECS updates without downtime.

2. Monitoring Enhancements â†’ Use Prometheus + Grafana along with CloudWatch for better observability.

3. Secrets Management â†’ Store sensitive configs in AWS Secrets Manager instead of hardcoding.

4. Cost Optimization â†’ Automate resource cleanup, use smaller Fargate task sizes, and enable CloudWatch log retention policies.

5. Automated Infrastructure Provisioning â†’ Migrate all manual steps (log group creation, repo setup) fully into Terraform/CloudFormation.
